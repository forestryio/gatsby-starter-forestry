title: What is this?

---
You're currently viewing a demo site built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Forestry](https://forestry.io). This website is meant to demonstrate some of the features of Forestry's CMS and how it integrates with the Gatsby static site generator, but you are encouraged to copy it, hack on it, and make it your own!

[About Gatsby »](/about-the-ssg)

## Demo Features
This demo is heavily influenced by Gatsby's [tutorial for using markdown](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/) and Kyle Mathews' [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). It is intended to serve as a starting point for developing markdown websites using Gatsby. Among its features are:

- Pages created from markdown files
- _List_ and _single_ templates (add an `index.md` file to a directory to create a list page for the directory's contents)
- Styling with Sass and [Bulma](https://bulma.io)
- A _blocks_ template to use with Forestry's [blocks](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/fields/blocks/) page builder capability.
- CMS-friendly content strategy, such as defining main navigation items in a JSON file.

## About Forestry

Forestry is a content management UI for static sites. Forestry currently supports Hugo, Jekyll, VuePress, and Gatsby, with support for more static site generators planned.

Forestry works by importing your static site from a cloud Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. You can then use our WYSIWYG and front matter UI to edit your markdown content and data files. When you save your content, Forestry creates a commit and pushes it back to your Git provider. This capability allows Forestry to be used alongside other workflows a team may be using to edit their static sites.
